Hi, my name is Shalom. 

Currently:
- Researcher in the Patient Decision Support Lab at CUIMC w/ Dr. Ruth Materson Creber and others. 
- in NYC

Previously:  
- OPTACIMM (Optimizing with Applied Clinical Informatics Models and Methods) lab w/ Dr. Sarah Rossetti and others.
- Research Scientist for Ensho Health (building algorithms to help physicians harness the power of the electronic medical record)
- Student at Columbia University 

In the future: 
- Trying to complete 100% of the achievements in Stardew Valley. It's a work in progress (just like my quest to collect every Harry Potter Lego set). 
- Completing a MSc at Queen's University funded by an NSERC CGS-M in 2024
=======
This past summer, I worked as a Research Scientist for Ensho Health, where I was responsible for developing an algorithm for a chronic neurological disease that helps clinicians better diagnose and manage it through data available in the electronic health record.
