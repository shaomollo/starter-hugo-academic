I am a senior at Columbia University studying Psychology and Public Health. I'm originally from Kenya, but home for me is in Sault Ste. Marie, Canada. 

My academic interests lie in bioinformatics. Currently, I do research for Dr. Sarah Rossetti as a part of the OPTACIMM (Optimizing with Applied Clinical Informatics Models and Methods) lab at the Columbia University Irving Medical Center. 

This past summer, I worked as a Research Scientist for Ensho Health, where I was responsible for developing an algorithm for a chronic neurological disease that helps clinicians better diagnose and manage it through data available in the electronic health record.

I'm also trying to complete 100% of the achievements in Stardew Valley. It's a work in progress (just like my quest to collect every Harry Potter Lego set).
